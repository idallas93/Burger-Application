# Eat Da Burger App

### Overview

This app is a burger logger that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This app  follows a MVC design pattern using Node and MySQL to query and route data/ Handlebars to generate HTML.

### Functionality

* Eat Da Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the top of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat it` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom of the page under "burgers that are eaten".

* The app store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
